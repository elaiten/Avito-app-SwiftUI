Parse screen data from Json

Interaction logic:
- Elements on a gray background from the example and the “Select” button are clickable, there is no cross.
- When you click on an element, it is highlighted - marked with a blue tick, or canceled.
- Only one item can be selected at a time.
- When you press the selection button, an alert is displayed with the name of the selected service.

The result is a screen that supports different user scenarios in different color schemes.
